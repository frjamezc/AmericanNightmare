      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Our project will consist of an infinitely scrollable webpage that outlines the numerous atrocities that the United States government has executed. Our goal is to educate the American people, young and old, on the subject of American war crimes and human rights violations. We intend to address the events that are glossed over and sugar-coated in the American educational system. The temporal breadth  we  intend to  cover  in the  past one  hundred years. Events include; WWII, Vietnam, the suppression of the counterculture movement of the 70s, whistleblower censorship,  etc. The page will have brief descriptions of the events, with images, videos, and works of art spanning the entire screen with links to resources for more information about the depicted events. </p>
